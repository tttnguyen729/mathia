IDEA 1

T-test

Does the FIDE rating of the top 100 US chess players have a correlation with their USCF ratings?

The null hypothesis is there is no correlation between FIDE rating and USCF rating.

Top 100 US Chess players as of October: (USCF)

FIDE ratings are located:

IDEA 2

How does the US Top 10 players compare with 10 other countries top 10?

ANOVA

The null hypothesis is that there is not a significant difference in mean rating among the 10 countries.

FIDE ratings can be found at

\subsection{Introduction}
As a young child, I've always been interested in the idea of quantifying and relating objects using numbers. This was initially a usefool tool in visualizing basic arithmetic. When I started playing tournament chess, I recieved a chess rating, or a number used to quantify one's chess strength relative to others. There are multiple such systems that give chess player ratings, for example online chess websites such as Lichess and Chess.com have their own rating systems, and even countries have their own rating systems. However, the governing body of chess, FIDE, has their own rating system that allows a standard rating for comparison between countries with otherwise different rating systems. This led to the foci of the investigation on how FIDE ratings compare to USCF ratings with respect to the top 10 players in the US and also comparing the strengths of the top 10 players of the top 10 countries.
\subsection{Research Questions}
How do the FIDE ratings compare to USCF ratings of the top 10 chess players in the US?

How different are the ratings between the top 10 players of the top 10 chess country federations?
\subsection{Hypothesis}
I predict that USCF ratings will be not much different from FIDE ratings. However, USCF ratings may be slightly higher as the overall pool of players with FIDE ratings has stronger players.

I predict that there will be a statistically significant difference between the FIDE ratings of the top 10 players of the top 10 countries as they have different concentrations of strong players.
